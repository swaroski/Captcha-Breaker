# Captcha-Breaker
Here we train a deep-learning model to recognize the digits in a captcha by building a dataset, on which we label and train the model. The objective is to help our model recognize digits. We gather a dataset of raw images, label and annotate them, train a custom CNN on the labeled dataset and then finally test and evaluate our model. Also, we visualize the results of the digits so that we can devise the successful implementation of this method.
