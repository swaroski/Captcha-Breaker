# Captcha-Breaker
Here we train a deep-learning model to recognize the digits in a captcha by building a dataset, on which we label and train the model. The objective is to help our model recognize digits. We gather a dataset of raw images, label and annotate them, train a custom CNN on the labeled dataset and then finally test and evaluate our model.
